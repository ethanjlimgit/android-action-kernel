**Android Use** connects AI Agents to native Android applications. It allows LLMs to interact with the "real world" apps that web agents cannot reach—Logistics, Gig Economy, Banking, and Identity.

> **🚧 The Problem:** Web Agents (`Browser Use`) are sandboxed in Chrome. Desktop Agents (`Computer Use`) are trapped on laptops.
>
> **✅ The Solution:** **Android Use** lives on the device where work actually happens. It creates a semantic bridge between your LLM and the chaotic native UI of Android.
